# RhithmFit

**Team: Issac Lin, Brittany Avalos-Ortiz, Raj Dalsaniya**

RhithmFit is an Android fitness tracker app designed to help users stay active, organized, and motivated. The app uses adaptive progression and scheduling algorithms to generate personalized workout plans, balancing strength, cardio, and recovery.  

A unique feature of RhithmFit is its **music motivation system**: based on the user’s heart rate (BPM), the app suggests songs with matching tempos. For example, faster heart rates bring up high-energy tracks for cardio, while slower BPM suggests steady rhythms for cool downs. This ensures workouts remain engaging and motivating throughout a session.
